# Multifactor Sequential Disentanglement via Structured Koopman Autoencoders (SKD)

## Overview
We propose a simple and easy to code new deep model that is fully unsupervised and it supports multifactor disentanglement. We showcase new disentangling abilities such as swapping of individual static factors between characters, and an incremental swap of disentangled factors from the source to the target.
